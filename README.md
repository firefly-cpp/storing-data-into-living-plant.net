## About
Step into the realm of unprecedented opportunities by encoding regular text into DNA sequences, unveiling a novel method of data representation. 🚀 Using a sophisticated process, each character in the text is meticulously translated into a specific arrangement of nucleotides, constructing a distinct genetic code that captures the essence of the original message. 🧬  

Join us in exploring the convergence of information technology and biotechnology, where your words are not just text, but vital seeds in the garden of life. 🌿🔬  

Embrace the future of information manipulation with our powerful and engaging solution. 🔮  

## Detailed insights
The current version comes packed with exciting features, including:
* **Encoding** 🧬📝<br />
The intricate process of converting custom text into a DNA sequence involves assigning each distinct character in the text to a specific arrangement of nucleotides, ultimately creating a unique genetic code that encapsulates the original message. 
* **Decoding** 🔍🔓<br />
The process of converting the encoded DNA sequence back into its original format involves decoding the sequence of nucleotides, which are the fundamental building blocks of DNA. This intricate process entails deciphering the sequence from their encoded representations.

With our application, you can plant custom text into a DNA sequence and watch it bloom back into its original format. 🌱💬
